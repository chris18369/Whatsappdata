Whatsappdata is a simple script you can use to breakdown text files exported from whatsapp conversations and do different levels of machine learning and data analysis projects.
Use: Put all the lists into a dictionary and from the dictionary build a dataframe to use for analysis
Problem 1: Right now the regex does not produce an even number of elements in each list. This implies that there is a problem with the way the text file string is split.
Problem 2 Right now the file does not do much and can be organized into a class more inclusions are coming.
